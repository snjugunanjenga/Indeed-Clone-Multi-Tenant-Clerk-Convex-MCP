"Jobly" is a fictional name used for this demo — we do not claim any trademark or intellectual property rights over it. This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Indeed, LinkedIn, or any other job platform**. All company names, job listings, and user data in the seed files are entirely fictional. Third-party service names (Clerk, Convex, Vercel, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.) are trademarks of their respective owners and are used here solely to describe the technologies used in this project.

A full-stack, real-time job board where **job seekers** search and apply for roles, and **employers** post jobs, review candidates, and manage their hiring pipeline — all from one app.

> **Who is this for?**
> Anyone who wants to learn how to build a production-grade, two-sided SaaS marketplace using modern tools — or anyone looking for a solid starter template to launch their own job platform.

> **What makes it different?**
> Every update is **real-time** (no page refreshes). Auth, billing, and organizations are handled by **Clerk**. The backend is powered by **Convex** — a reactive database that pushes changes to the client instantly. Multi-tenant company workspaces come built-in with role-based access control.

> **Under the hood**
> Next.js 16 App Router · Convex reactive backend · Clerk auth + organizations + billing · Tiptap rich text editor · shadcn/ui · Tailwind CSS v4 · Zod + React Hook Form · TypeScript strict mode

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **pnpm** (package manager) — `npm install -g pnpm`
- A **[Clerk](https://go.clerk.com/INxQv2R)** account
- A **[Convex](https://convex.dev/referral/SONNYS4371)** account

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/indeed-clone-clerk-nextjs-16.git
cd indeed-clone-clerk-nextjs-16
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```env
# Clerk — https://go.clerk.com/INxQv2R
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Convex — https://convex.dev/referral/SONNYS4371
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud

# Clerk JWT issuer for Convex auth
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://your-clerk-instance.clerk.accounts.dev

# Clerk webhook signing secret (from Svix)
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_...
```

> 🔒 **Security:** Never commit `.env.local` to git. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix means the value is exposed to the browser — only use it for public keys like `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

### 4. Set up Clerk

1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://go.clerk.com/INxQv2R) and create a new application
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** into `.env.local`
3. Enable **Organizations** in the Clerk dashboard (Settings → Organizations)
4. Set up **Billing** plans (Free, Starter, Growth) in the Clerk dashboard if you want subscription management
5. Create organization roles: `admin`, `recruiter`, `member`

### 5. Set up Convex

1. Run `npx convex dev` — this will prompt you to create a new project or link an existing one
2. Copy the **Convex URL** it gives you into `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
3. Set the `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` environment variable in the [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) (Settings → Environment Variables)

### 6. Configure Clerk Webhooks

This is how Clerk keeps your Convex database in sync with user and organization changes.

1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **Webhooks** and create a new endpoint
2. Set the URL to: `https://YOUR_CONVEX_URL/webhooks/clerk`
   - Replace `YOUR_CONVEX_URL` with your Convex HTTP Actions URL (e.g. `https://your-project.convex.site/webhooks/clerk`)
3. Subscribe to these events:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `user.deleted`
   - `organization.created`
   - `organization.updated`
   - `organization.deleted`
   - `organizationMembership.created`
   - `organizationMembership.updated`
   - `organizationMembership.deleted`
4. Copy the **Signing Secret** and add it to your Convex environment variables as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`

### 7. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs both the Next.js frontend and the Convex backend in parallel. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### First-Time Setup Checklist

- [ ] Clerk account created and keys added to `.env.local`
- [ ] Convex project linked and URL added to `.env.local`
- [ ] Clerk Organizations enabled
- [ ] Clerk Webhooks configured and signing secret added to Convex env vars
- [ ] `pnpm dev` runs without errors
- [ ] You can sign up and see the home page

## 🗄️ Database Schema Overview

Jobly uses **Convex** as its database with a flat, relational schema design. All tables are defined in [`convex/schema.ts`](convex/schema.ts).

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **users** | Synced from Clerk via webhooks | `clerkUserId`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `imageUrl` |
| **profiles** | Extended candidate profiles | `userId`, `headline`, `bio`, `skills[]`, `openToWork`, `yearsExperience` |
| **experiences** | Work history entries | `userId`, `title`, `company`, `startDate`, `isCurrent`, `order` |
| **education** | Education history | `userId`, `school`, `degree`, `fieldOfStudy`, `order` |
| **certifications** | Professional certifications | `userId`, `name`, `issuingOrg`, `credentialUrl` |
| **resumes** | Uploaded resume files | `userId`, `storageId`, `fileName`, `isDefault` |
| **companies** | Synced from Clerk Organizations | `clerkOrgId`, `name`, `plan`, `seatLimit`, `jobLimit` |
| **companyMembers** | Org membership with roles | `companyId`, `userId`, `role`, `status` |
| **jobListings** | Posted jobs | `companyId`, `title`, `description`, `salaryMin/Max`, `tags[]`, `isActive` |
| **applications** | Job applications from candidates | `jobId`, `applicantUserId`, `status`, `coverLetter`, `resumeId` |
| **favorites** | Bookmarked jobs | `userId`, `jobId` |
| **notifications** | In-app notifications | `userId`, `type`, `title`, `message`, `isRead` |

### Design Decisions

- **Flat, relational design** — No deep nesting. Tables reference each other by ID, following Convex best practices.
- **Clerk ID mapping** — `users` and `companies` store their Clerk IDs (`clerkUserId`, `clerkOrgId`) and are synced via webhooks so the Convex database is always up to date.
- **Search indexes** — `jobListings` has a full-text search index on `searchText` with filters for `isActive`, `companyId`, `workplaceType`, and `employmentType`.
- **Denormalized `companyName`** — Stored directly on `jobListings` to avoid extra lookups when displaying job cards.
- **Ordered collections** — `experiences` and `education` use an `order` field with a compound index for drag-and-drop reordering.

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Development

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `pnpm dev` only starts one server | Make sure `npm-run-all2` is installed. The `dev` script runs `dev:frontend` and `dev:backend` in parallel. |
| Convex types not updating | Run `npx convex dev` in a separate terminal. It generates types in `convex/_generated/`. |
| Page shows "Loading..." forever | Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is correct in `.env.local`. |

### Authentication

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Webhook returns 400 | Verify the signing secret matches. Make sure you're using `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (not `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`). |
| User signs up but doesn't appear in Convex | Check that Clerk webhooks are configured and the endpoint URL points to your Convex HTTP Actions URL (`/webhooks/clerk`). |
| "Missing Svix headers" error | The webhook request isn't coming from Clerk. Verify the endpoint URL is correct. |

### Database

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Index not found" error | Run `npx convex dev` to push your schema. Indexes are defined in `convex/schema.ts`. |
| Schema validation errors after changes | If you change field types, you may need to clear and re-seed. Run the seed function from the Convex dashboard. |

### Billing

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| PricingTable not showing plans | Make sure Clerk Billing is enabled and plans are configured in the Clerk dashboard. |
| Plan not updating after payment | The plan is synced via Clerk organization metadata. Check that the organization webhook events are being received. |

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Useful Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start both Next.js and Convex in parallel |
| `pnpm build` | Build the Next.js app for production |
| `pnpm start` | Start the production server |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint across the project |
| `npx convex dev` | Start the Convex dev server (auto-generates types) |
| `npx convex deploy` | Deploy Convex to production |
| `npx convex dashboard` | Open the Convex dashboard in your browser |

### Key Files & Folders

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/` | Next.js App Router pages and layouts |
| `app/(app)/` | Route group for candidate features (jobs, applications, favorites, profile, notifications) |
| `app/company/` | Route group for employer features (dashboard, jobs, applications, billing) |
| `app/pricing/` | Pricing page with Clerk PricingTable |
| `convex/` | Convex backend functions and schema |
| `convex/schema.ts` | Database schema definition |
| `convex/http.ts` | Clerk webhook HTTP endpoint |
| `convex/sync.ts` | Webhook sync logic (users, orgs, memberships) |
| `convex/seed.ts` | Database seeding script |
| `components/` | Shared React components |
| `components/ui/` | shadcn/ui components |
| `lib/` | Utility functions and hooks |
| `proxy.ts` | Clerk middleware for route protection |
| `.env.local` | Environment variables (not committed) |

### Important Concepts

- **Route Groups** — `(app)` and `company` are Next.js route groups that share different layouts. `(app)` has a candidate sidebar/nav, `company` has an employer sidebar.
- **Convex Functions** — Queries are reactive (auto-update the UI), mutations change data, actions talk to external APIs. All defined in the `convex/` directory.
- **Clerk Organizations** — Each company workspace is a Clerk organization. Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles.
- **Webhook Sync** — When a user signs up or an organization is created in Clerk, a webhook fires and syncs the data to Convex. This keeps the two systems in sync without manual API calls.
- **`proxy.ts` Middleware** — Replaces traditional `middleware.ts` in Next.js 16. Protects routes and ensures company routes require organization membership.
